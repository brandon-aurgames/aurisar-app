/**
 * ActorRig — one live actor: a root transform, the stage mesh under it, the
 * LOD tier that picks which stage, and the shadow-caster registration.
 *
 * ONE MESH PER ACTOR, and that is a budget commitment, not a simplification.
 * realmActorBudget.test.js spends `maxSimultaneousActors * 1` draw call
 * against whatever props leave of BUDGET_CEILINGS; slicing the payload's
 * per-mass vertex ranges into child nodes would multiply that by the mass
 * count (11 for orghon) and quietly invalidate a census that has already been
 * signed off. A SKELETON ADDS NO DRAW CALL — the bone palette rides the same
 * draw as a block of vertex uniforms (THE PIN, ActorSkeleton.js) — so the
 * census still stands with bones in it.
 *
 * ── THE SKELETON IS PER RIG, AND IT OUTLIVES EVERY MESH THIS RIG OWNS ───────
 *
 * `Mesh.clone()` copies the `skeleton` REFERENCE (a live engine fact, asserted
 * in ActorSkeleton.test.js), so a skeleton parked on ActorPrototypes' shared
 * master would be shared by every actor of that archetype: one guard raises an
 * arm and the whole faction raises one. `buildActorSkeleton` therefore runs
 * ONCE per ActorRig, at construction, and `_applyTier` RE-ATTACHES it to each
 * fresh clone. That re-attachment is not belt-and-braces: the master carries
 * no skeleton to copy, so a clone arrives with `skeleton === null` and would
 * render its bind pose forever — a character that walks around the world
 * without bending a joint.
 *
 * THE POSE IS RETAINED ACROSS A TIER SWAP. Bone state lives on the Skeleton,
 * and a swap rebuilds only the MESH, so an actor mid-stride that crosses the
 * 96 m band edge keeps its stride: no re-application, no bookkeeping, nothing
 * to forget. The rejected alternative — reset to rest and let the caller pose
 * again — would make the LOD boundary visible as a one-frame T-pose, the exact
 * class of artefact the hysteresis in `tierForDistance` exists to prevent.
 * ActorRigSkin.test.js asserts the palette is BYTE-IDENTICAL either side of a
 * forced swap, so "retained" is measured rather than reasoned.
 *
 * NO ANIMATION AND NO CLIPS — not even an idle bob. `setPose`/`rest` are the
 * whole motion surface, and they are absolute (ActorSkeleton.js): what drives
 * them over time is P9's.
 *
 * NEVER freezeWorldMatrix(). PropStreamer freezes its carriers and is right
 * to — a prop chunk's world matrix is identity forever and the instance
 * matrices carry the world. An actor's whole job is to move, and a frozen
 * matrix would pin it wherever it was first drawn while every other system
 * (camera focus, shadow bucketing, the sim) went on believing it had walked
 * away. ActorRig.test.js proves the absence behaviourally: move the root,
 * recompute, and the mesh's absolutePosition must follow.
 *
 * GROUND SEATING, and the residual it cannot remove. The root sits at the
 * actor's ground-contact point — `seatOn(x, groundY, z)` takes the terrain
 * height directly — and the mesh hangs at a local `-minY` so the payload's
 * LOWEST VERTEX lands exactly on `groundY`. That correction is per STAGE,
 * because minY is not stage-invariant: a capped foot's near stage (icosphere
 * level 2) reaches slightly BELOW the authored sole plane while its far stage
 * (level 1) reaches only 0.851r down and stops slightly above it. Measured
 * across the roster: near -0.010..0.000, far 0.000..+0.011. Seating by the
 * live stage's own minY is what stops a near actor standing 5-10 mm into the
 * ground.
 *
 * What survives is the DIFFERENCE: swapping tier translates the body by
 * minY(near) - minY(far), at worst 0.0211 m (orghon). The tier boundary is
 * 96 m away, where that subtends under a third of a pixel at 1080p, so it is
 * sub-pixel exactly where it happens. It is NOT fixed by sinking the feet
 * into the far-stage geometry: every band-occupancy measurement the phase's
 * exit-bar gate rests on (gen/actorSilhouette.test.js) is taken against this
 * geometry, and moving a vertex to hide a third of a pixel would move them.

/**
 * Grow a live actor mesh's LOCAL bounding box by `ACTOR_POSE_MARGIN_M` on

 * inside. model/actorEnvelope.js carries the measurement, the headroom
 * argument and the P9 revisit trigger; this is only the application.
 *
 * ON THE CLONE, NOT ON THE MASTER, and that placement is a MEASURED ENGINE
 * FACT rather than a preference. Expanding the master looks like the obvious
 * one-write-serves-every-actor move — it is where the skinning buffers are
 * written, for exactly that reason — but `Mesh.clone()` does NOT copy the
 * source's `_boundingInfo`: it derives a fresh one from the shared geometry's
 * vertex extents. Measured on unbound near stage with a 0.35 m probe margin:
 * master reads min.x -0.7250 after `setBoundingInfo`, and its clone reads
 * -0.3750 — the untouched rest value. So the master version of this fix is
 * a silent no-op that reviews perfectly. Poking `geometry._extend` instead
 * fails the same way (`refreshBoundingInfo` re-derives it from the buffer).
 *
 * It STICKS, which is the other half of the question: measured across
 * parenting, `setEnabled`, the skeleton attach, `setPose`, two `scene.render`
 * passes and a moved root, the local box stays expanded and the WORLD box
 * tracks the world matrix (root at x=30 gives world min.x 29.275 = 30 - 0.725).
 * Babylon never recomputes it on its own; only an explicit
 * `refreshBoundingInfo()` would, and nothing here calls one.
 *
 * Called on every pass through `_applyTier`, not just the first, for the same
 * reason the skeleton re-attach is: each tier swap builds a NEW clone, and a
 * fresh clone arrives with the rest-pose box again.
