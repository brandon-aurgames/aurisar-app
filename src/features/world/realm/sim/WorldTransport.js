/**
 * WorldTransport — the seam between the Realm's simulation and any server.
 *
 * PURE. This module is the contract only: an enum, two constructors, and a
 * JSDoc-typed interface. It imports nothing.
 *
 * ─── This is where "connect to the server" lives ──────────────────────────────
 * The original brief asked for state handlers with explicit
 * `// TODO: Connect to WebSocket server` hooks. Those hooks are this interface.
 * There is no TODO to fill in later: every command already flows through
 * `send()`, and swapping which implementation is installed is the entire
 * difference between offline and online. SpacetimeDB is the production
 * implementation; `LocalTransport` runs the same authoritative logic in-process
 * for tests, for the no-auth dev viewer, and when the connection drops.
 *
 * Two implementations must satisfy this contract identically. The conformance
 * suite runs against both — if a behaviour is only asserted for one, it will
 * drift, and drift here means "works offline, breaks in production".
