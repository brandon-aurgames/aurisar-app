/**
 * actorArchetypes — the four faction rosters, authored as MASS ALLOCATION.
 *
 * PURE data. This file is the DESIGN: the four tables below and the measured
 * evidence attached to them are the whole aesthetic decision of P6, and
 * everything downstream only renders them.
 *
 * IMPORT SURFACE: do not import this file directly. `model/actorMasses.js` is
 * the public entry point and re-exports `ARCHETYPES`; it also owns
 * `archetypeById`, `pivotsOf`, and the stage constants. This file exists as a
 * separate module only because the combined one reached 394 lines against a
 * 400 ceiling, and the next thing that happens here is Task 5 pasting
 * re-measured band evidence in — comments in this file grow by design.
 *
 * It is deliberately a ZERO-IMPORT LEAF, which is why `freezeArchetype` lives
 * here rather than with the rest of the vocabulary in actorMasses.js. The
 * alternative — helper there, tables here — is a genuine ESM cycle whose
 * failure is order-dependent: importing actorMasses.js first happens to work
 * (hoisted function declaration), while importing THIS file first throws
 * `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'ARCHETYPES' before initialization` when
 * actorMasses builds its lookup Map. Verified, not theorised. A leaf cannot
 * have that problem in either order.
 *
 * WHY MASS ALLOCATION, MEASURED. A probe built these same four factions the
 * obvious way — one shared humanoid skeleton, per-faction proportion
 * multipliers, plus a small bolted-on faction organ — and measured worst-pair
 * canonical silhouette IoU 0.941. For scale, the shipped tree props measure
 * 0.200 across species: 0.941 is "these are the same character in four
 * colours". Re-authoring the identical four by REALLOCATING MASS ACROSS
 * WORLD-Y BANDS pulled the worst pair to 0.678. So faction identity lives in
 * WHERE the mass is, never in how tall or how thick a shared body is. If a
 * future edit distinguishes two archetypes by making one 15% taller or one
 * limb 20% thicker, it is rebuilding the 0.941 roster.
 *
 * What THESE tables measure, against ACTOR_WINDOW at GATE_PITCH_RAD and
 * GATE_RES: worst pair 0.506 near / 0.501 far (Magistari vs Orghon, the two
 * bottom-heavy bodies), best-separated pair 0.271 (Legion vs Orghon, the
 * roster's two histogram opposites). The gate is 0.72 and the probe's
 * demonstrated benchmark was 0.678, so the roster clears the bar by
 * reallocating mass further than the probe did, not by relaxing anything.
 * gen/actorSilhouette.test.js is what keeps that true.
 */

/** Faction palettes. Colour is silhouette-irrelevant by design (the exit bar
 *  includes a colour-blindness control proving the gate cannot be satisfied
 *  by tint) — it exists so an actor reads as its faction up close too. */

/**
 * The roster. `id` and `factionId` are separate fields even though they are
 * equal today: P6 ships exactly one archetype per faction, but the roster
 * this table is shaped for spans species x class x faction, at which point
 * many archetype ids map to one factionId.
 *
 * `bandTargets` are [belowWaist, torso, aboveShoulder] fractions of filled
 * silhouette area, MEASURED from bandOccupancy against [WAIST_Y, SHOULDER_Y]
 * in ACTOR_WINDOW — not design intent. The band histogram is the LEADING
 * indicator of roster separation and pairwise IoU is the lagging one, so
 * these numbers are what an author edits against; gen/actorSilhouette.test.js
 * holds them to a declared tolerance.
 *
 * MASSES ARE AUTHORED AS A CHAIN OF SHARED ENDPOINTS. A limb's `a` is
 * literally its parent's joint coordinate, so pivotsOf finds the skeleton
 * without anyone declaring one. The first draft of this table placed limbs
 * where they looked right instead, and pivotsOf returned 0 pivots for Legion
 * and 1 for Magistari — the "P7 topology for free" claim was false, and the
 * caps had nothing to nest inside either. Both problems have the same fix.
 *
 * CLOSING A JOINT — TWO MECHANISMS, AND THE LIMIT ON THE FIRST ONE. Every
 * mass is an OPEN tube (gen/propPrimitives.js's addTube emits side faces
 * only), so a joint leaves its neighbours' end rings exposed unless
 * something closes them. Exactly two things do:
 *
 *   CAP — the WIDEST mass meeting there carries a rounded cap and the
 *     narrower neighbours' rings end up buried inside that sphere. This
 *     only works while the neighbour is genuinely NARROWER, by a margin
 *     that is a measured constant rather than a matter of taste: addBlob
 *     INSCRIBES its polyhedron in the requested radius, so a cap of radius
 *     R reaches only inradiusRatio·R in its worst direction — 0.9342 at
 *     CAP_LEVEL 2 (near) and 0.7947 at CAP_LEVEL 1 (far), both measured off
 *     sphereFaces in gen/actorSeal.test.js. A neighbouring ring of radius R
 *     at a cap of radius R is therefore NOT buried at all: the ring's
 *     vertices sit exactly ON the circumsphere while the cap's faces are
 *     chords inside it, and the annulus between them is open surface.
 *
 *   RING — two masses meeting at a shared point with the SAME radius and
 *     the same axis LINE generate IDENTICAL ring vertices and weld shut
 *     with no cap at all. Parallel axes (magistari's robe stack, orghon's
 *     throat) weld at any SEG; OPPOSITE axes (legion's face-plate halves,
 *     magistari's cowl bar) additionally need SEG even, which
 *     model/actorMasses.test.js pins.
 *
 * ...plus a cap at every terminal end — feet, hands, head, crest tips.
 *
 * model/actorMasses.js's `pivotsOf` reports which mechanism holds each
 * joint as `closure: 'cap' | 'ring'`, and actorMasses.test.js fails any
 * joint that has neither. That matters to P7 and not only to P6: see
 * gen/actorPrimitives.js's header on why a ring-closed joint is
 * POSE-LOCKED.

   * Orghon — EVERYTHING BELOW THE WAIST. Massive thighs under a hip slab
   * (two opposed masses off one pelvis pivot), a torso hunched forward off
   * it, a low head topping out at 1.44 m, and arms long enough to reach past
   * the knees. Its above-shoulder band measures 0.001 — the whole body ends
   * below where Legion's face-plate begins, and that single number is what
   * separates it from Magistari, the only other bottom-heavy archetype.
