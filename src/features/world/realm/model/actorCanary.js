/**
 * actorCanary — the pose every downstream skinning gate poses with.
 *
 * PURE, and a one-way consumer of model/actorRig.js (rig in, pose table out).
 * Split out of actorRig.js when that file reached 399 lines against a 400
 * ceiling; nothing in actorRig.js imports this, so there is no cycle.
 *
 * IT EXISTS BECAUSE A SKINNING TEST IS TRIVIAL TO WRITE VACUOUSLY. Skin a
 * mesh, pose nothing, compare against the unskinned mesh: it passes, it passes
 * forever, and it passes just as well when every vertex is welded to bone 0.
 * This project has shipped eight tests that could not fail. So every non-root
 * bone gets a rotation, no bone shares an angle with another, and no angle is
 * an integer multiple of another (the prime-degree ladder 7/11/13/17/19/23/29).
 * Strictly those are commensurate — all rational multiples of a degree — but
 * what matters is that swapping two bones, doubling one, or dropping one to
 * zero all change the palette, and a prime ladder guarantees all three.
 *
 * THE AXIS IS ORTHOGONAL TO THE BONE'S LIMB DIRECTION, and that is a DESIGN
 * property, asserted directly in actorCanary.test.js rather than left to the
 * displacement numbers to imply. Rotating about a limb's own axis spins a
 * capsule on its centreline and moves almost nothing — the most expensive kind
 * of vacuous canary, articulated in the table and inert in the mesh. Measured:
 * replacing `orthogonalAxis(limbDirection(b))` with `limbDirection(b)`, so
 * every canary becomes a pure twist, drops the worst endpoint travel to 0.174
 * (unbound), 0.156 (legion), 0.000 (magistari) and 0.117 m (orghon) — and
 * against a displacement floor alone, LEGION STILL PASSES at 0.156 against the
 * shipped floor of 0.12 (`TRAVEL.legion.min`, actorCanary.test.js, which
 * records why 0.124 is the wrong number to quote here). The floor is a second
 * net, not the net; the orthogonality assertion is what makes the mutation
 * fail on all four.
 *
 * ...AND IT IS ORTHOGONAL TO THE BONE'S *SUMMED* DIRECTION, NOT TO EACH MASS.
 * A bone owning several masses gets one axis, so an individual mass can still
 * be close to a pure twist: legion's fused face plate is EXACTLY one
 * (|cos| = 1.0000 for faceL and faceR), its crest bars 0.9972, its yokes
 * 0.9778, orghon's hip slabs 0.9839. Their ENDPOINTS therefore barely move —
 * orghon's hipL travels 0.0049 m, legion's yokeL 0.0115 m — and a per-mass
 * assertion keyed on endpoint travel would be within a hair of vacuous.
 *
 * WHAT SAVES IT IS THE SURFACE, and Task 3 and Task 4 must key their per-mass
 * assertions on surface vertices for exactly this reason. A twisted capsule's
 * axis stays put while its skin sweeps around it, so measured over each mass's
 * two end rings (8 azimuths each), EVERY mass in the roster has a surface
 * vertex moving at least 0.0288 m — the worst case being unbound's neck, with
 * legion's yokeL at 0.0340, orghon's hipL at 0.0385 and magistari's spine at
 * 0.0527. Endpoint travel is the wrong statistic; surface travel is the one
 * with a floor.
 *
 * THE LADDER RUNS ASCENDING BY BONE INDEX — BFS order, so roughly depth order
 * — because angles COMPOUND down a chain and the shallow bones carry the long
 * lever arms. Compared honestly, i.e. reversing the assignment of the SAME
 * multiset of angles rather than taking different angles off the ladder:
 *
 *   ascending    0.572 (unbound)  0.207 (legion)  0.260 (orghon)
 *   reversed     0.666            0.266           0.250
 *
 * Ascending wins on unbound and legion and LOSES on orghon by 0.010 m. It is
 * kept because it wins where the numbers are big and loses where they are
 * small — not because it wins everywhere. Magistari is deliberately absent
 * from that table: it has one non-root bone, so there is no order to reverse
 * and its 0.053 m is the same either way. An earlier version of this comment
 * compared against angles taken off the TOP of the ladder, which changed the
 * ANGLE BUDGET as well as the order (legion 101 degrees of total rotation
 * against 67) and so overstated the case; these are the same-multiset numbers.
 *
 * Unbound's 0.572 m is the fist, four joints down the graft chain (11+17+23+29
 * degrees of compounding). This comment used to predict that Task 3's posed
 * seal gate would bind on it first, and to prescribe "if it fails, shrink the
 * angle." Task 3 MEASURED that prediction and found it false: the posed
 * seal's two-sided ray criterion never fires, even scaled far past what
 * ships (every joint swept to 179 degrees alone, and the whole pose scaled
 * 10x). Every joint in this roster closes by a mechanism that is pose-
 * invariant at ANY angle — a cap pivot's sphere is rotation-invariant about
 * its own centre, and a ring pivot's two masses are always fused onto the
 * SAME bone by buildActorRigOfMasses (model/actorRig.js's header) rather than
 * ever sitting on opposite sides of a rotation — so "shrink the angle" was
 * never an available response to that particular gate failing, for any
 * angle in this table.
 *
 * What DOES validate a ring weld against tearing is a structural fact, not
 * an angle: whether that fusion still holds. gen/actorSealPose.test.js's
 * one-sided-escape baseline and its direct ring-weld coincidence gate check
 * this directly (a torn weld is provably a ONE-SIDED aperture, which the
 * two-sided criterion is blind to by construction — see that file), and a
 * regression here should be diagnosed against THOSE gates, not against this
 * table's angle sizes. The travel-floor envelope (`TRAVEL`, in
 * actorCanary.test.js) is a separate, still-valid concern keyed on angle
 * magnitude; this correction does not touch it.

/**
 * Distinct, non-multiple canary angles in DEGREES. Nine entries because the
 * roster's deepest rig (unbound, after P9's leg split) has nine non-root
 * bones; a future archetype with more runs off the end, which `canaryPoseFor`
 * refuses loudly rather than wrapping the ladder and quietly duplicating an
 * angle.
 *
 * THE ORDER IS AN ASSIGNMENT BY LEVER, NOT A SORT. Through P8 the ladder ran
 * ascending by bone index ("shallow bones carry the long lever arms"), and
 * P9's leg split broke both ends of that reasoning at once, measured:
 *
 *   - The new hip-cluster bone lands at index 1 on the SHORTEST lever in the
 *     roster and drew the smallest angle: legion's hipL surface moved
 *     0.0153 m against the 0.02 m vacuity floor. An inert canary is the
 *     exact failure this table exists to prevent.
 *   - The graft chain slid DEEPER (indices 6/8/9), so ascending handed its
 *     longest levers the biggest angles: worst endpoint travel 0.692 m
 *     against the 0.6 m sealed-envelope ceiling — and pushing the pose
 *     envelope re-opens ACTOR_POSE_MARGIN_M's frustum AND shadow budgets.
 *
 * So the SAME angle set is now placed by hand: big angles on short levers
 * (hips 13°, head 29°), small angles on long ones (legs 7°/17°, graft chain
 * 19/23/25 compounding 78° where ascending gave 104°). The properties the
 * gates actually assert are untouched: distinct, ≤ 30°, pairwise
 * non-integer-multiple (25 and 27 are composite — primality was never the
 * property, non-aliasing is). Per-index, for the deepest rig (unbound):
 * [b1 hips, b2 shoulders, b3 legL, b4 legR, b5 armL, b6 graftUpper, b7 head,
 *  b8 graftFore, b9 fist].
