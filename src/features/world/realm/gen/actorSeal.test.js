/**
 * actorSeal.test.js — you cannot see through an actor.
 *
 * P6's exit bar is about OUTLINES, and every gate built for it is blind to
 * this by construction: model/silhouette.js rasterizes a filled mask, so a
 * hole punched clean through a body changes no silhouette, no band histogram,
 * no IoU and no manifest figure. gen/winding.test.js is blind too — it asks
 * which WAY each triangle faces, never whether a triangle is there at all.
 * Both blindnesses are correct for what those files measure, and together
 * they left the surface itself ungated.
 *
 * The P6 review found the gap by hand. Magistari's shoulder was two coaxial
 * octagons of radius 0.17 and 0.16 in the plane y = 1.40 with no cap between
 * them: a ~9 mm annulus, missed by the sleeves (they leave along +/-x, the
 * leak was at +/-z), through which a ray fired straight down at (0, +/-0.165)
 * crossed the ENTIRE actor and hit ZERO triangles — in through the annulus,
 * out through the open hem. Orghon's throat was a 24 mm slit between two
 * equal-radius rings whose axes were 8 degrees apart.
 *
 * WHAT "SEALED" MEANS HERE, precisely, because the honest version is narrower
 * than "watertight" and the difference matters:
 *
 *   - Actors are NOT watertight and are not meant to be. Magistari's hem is
 *     deliberately open (model/actorArchetypes.js explains why a hem cap is
 *     refused), and every joint buries neighbouring open rings inside a
 *     wider mass rather than trimming them, so a boundary-edge census counts
 *     104-208 open edges per archetype and always will.
 *   - So the property gated is CLEAN PASS-THROUGH: a ray that starts outside,
 *     passes through a point PROVABLY INSIDE some mass, and reaches the far
 *     side having crossed zero triangles. That takes two aligned holes, and
 *     it is exactly the defect a player sees as background through a body.
 *   - Rays are only counted when their sample point is inside a mass's own
 *     PRISM (radius scaled by the apothem cos(pi/SEG), never the circumradius).
 *     That distinction is not pedantry: the review's own orghon fan reported
 *     4 pass-throughs at offsets 0.165 and 0.170 from a neck whose ring
 *     radius is 0.170 — between the octagon's apothem (0.1571) and its
 *     circumradius (0.1700), so those rays never entered the solid at all and
 *     were measuring the gap between a circle and the polygon inside it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GATE DOES NOT CATCH, stated up front rather than discovered
 * later — the same mistake gen/actorPrimitives.js's old cap contract made.
 *
 *   - ONE-SIDED apertures. A gap you can see the actor's dark interior
 *     through, but not the background, crosses one triangle and passes.
 *     Orghon's throat was exactly that, which is why group 3 pins the throat
 *     by its MECHANISM (the ring weld) rather than by a ray count.
 *   - FAR-STAGE CAP PINHOLES. A cap of radius R does not cover its OWN
 *     tube's end ring, for the reason group 1 measures, so at CAP_LEVEL 1
 *     every capped end carries an annulus up to 0.2R wide. Swept at 1652
 *     directions from 1375 interior points (2.27 M rays, far too slow to be
 *     a gate), the far stage still shows 16 see-through rays on unbound,
 *     68 on legion and 2 on orghon — 0.0007% to 0.003%, all of them
 *     near-axis threads through two coaxial cap annuli. The near stage is
 *     clean at that density; so is magistari at both. Closing them means
 *     changing how addMass composes tube and cap, which is LOCKED to Task
 *     2's measurement stand-in (see gen/actorPrimitives.js), so they are
 *     recorded here rather than papered over. The 26-direction grid below
 *     does not reach them; it does reach both joints the review found.
 *
 * Deterministic throughout: fixed axial fractions, fixed radial fractions,
 * fixed azimuths, fixed direction set. No randomness, no time, no hashing.
 *
 * The ray-cast/interior-point machinery (`crossings`, `interiorPoints`,
 * `DIRECTIONS`, `AXIAL`, `RADIAL`, `AZIMUTHS`) lives in gen/rayFan.js —
 * extracted so gen/actorSealPose.test.js's posed seal reuses the identical
 * epsilons and sampling grid rather than a hand-copied second one that could
 * drift. This file's own numbers (found lists, ray counts) are unchanged by
 * the extraction; only the `function`/`const` declarations moved.
