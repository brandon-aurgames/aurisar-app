 * Three surfaces filter the same catalog — the library tab, the workout
 * builder picker, and the plan wizard — and each had grown its own copy of
 * this predicate plus its own option lists. They drifted, repeatedly and
 * invisibly: the builder picker was missing `full_body` and four exercise
 * types, the equipment facet was missing three values, and the plan wizard
 * was missing `tricep` and `full_body` — 188 exercises it could not filter to.
 *
 * The rule: OR within a facet (chest OR back), AND across facets (chest AND
 * barbell). An empty facet means "no constraint", not "nothing matches".
