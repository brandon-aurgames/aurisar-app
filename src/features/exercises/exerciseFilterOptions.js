/**
 * The filter vocabulary, in one place.
 *
 * These lists existed three times: `LIB_ALL_MUSCLE_OPTS` / `LIB_ALL_EQUIP_OPTS`
 * in useExerciseFilters, `TYPE_OPTS` / `TYPE_LABELS` in ExerciseLibraryTab, and
 * `PMUSCLE_OPTS` / `PTYPE_LABELS` / `PEQUIP_OPTS` in WorkoutExercisePicker —
 * and they had already drifted. The picker's muscle list was missing
 * `full_body`, and its type list was missing functional, isometric, warmup and
 * cooldown, so the same exercise was reachable from the library and invisible
 * from the workout builder depending on how you filtered.
 *
 * Anything that filters exercises imports from here.
