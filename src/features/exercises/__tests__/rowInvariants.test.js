/**
 * Guards for two bugs that shipped and were caught in review, not by tests.
 *
 * Both were "someone forgot to pair X with Y" rather than bad logic, and
 * neither is reachable by a normal unit test:
 *
 *   1. The stretched-overlay bug is a *layout* bug — a `::after` painting over
 *      sibling controls so clicks land on the wrong element. jsdom has no
 *      layout engine and no paint order, so even with testing-library the
 *      failure would not reproduce. Only a real browser can catch it, and only
 *      if someone thinks to look.
 *
 *   2. The picker Escape bug was a modal wired to a bare setter instead of the
 *      teardown function everything else used.
 *
 * So these assert the *pairings* at the source level. That is weaker than a
 * behavioural test — it proves the wiring exists, not that it works — but it
 * catches the way both defects actually recur: a new row or a new dismissal
 * path that forgets the safeguard.
