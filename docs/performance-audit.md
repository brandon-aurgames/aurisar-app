## Background

Users are seeing general sluggishness across the app, including:

- Mobile scrolling briefly showing a black screen before content appears.
- Delayed response after selecting "Complete" or "Mark Complete or Schedule" for a workout.
- General slowness during tab changes, filtering, workout actions, and profile/log updates.

The source audit suggests the performance issues are not caused by one isolated bug. They come from a combination of broad React re-renders, expensive synchronous work, mobile GPU-heavy CSS, repeated full-list calculations, and a very large top-level `App.jsx` that owns too many responsibilities.

`src/App.jsx` was **16,204 lines** at audit time. Currently **7,079 lines** (−9,125, −56%) after PRs #121–#143.

---

## Findings

### 1. Render-time random particle positions cause repaint churn

**Location:** [src/App.jsx:5984](../src/App.jsx#L5984)

The app renders decorative particles with `Math.random()` inside JSX. Every React render gives those fixed-position particles new `bottom` values. That means unrelated state updates can move visual background elements and trigger unnecessary repaint/compositing work.

```jsx
{PARTICLES.map(p => <div key={p.id} className={"pt"} style={{
  left: `${p.x}%`,
  bottom: `${Math.random() * 100}%`,  // ← recomputed on every render
  width: p.size,
  height: p.size,
  ...
}} />)}
```

**Impact:**

- More expensive renders than necessary.
- Worse mobile scroll performance.
- Possible black-frame / checkerboarding behavior while the browser repaints.

**Recommended fix:**

- Move particle positioning out of render.
- Generate all particle positions once, either in constants or `useMemo`.
- Keep animated background elements stable across renders.
- Consider disabling particles entirely on lower-end / mobile devices.

---

### 2. Heavy fixed blur and backdrop layers likely contribute to mobile black-frame scrolling

**Location:** [src/styles/app.css](../src/styles/app.css)

The app uses fixed background gradients ([`.bg`](../src/styles/app.css#L17)), animated blurred particles ([`.pt`](../src/styles/app.css#L18)), sticky blurred headers, fixed blurred bottom navigation ([`.hud-nav-panel`](../src/styles/app.css#L82)), shadows, and `backdrop-filter` across high-frequency UI areas. There are **29 `backdrop-filter` selectors** in the stylesheet. The main content scrolls inside [`.scroll-area`](../src/styles/app.css#L91), while multiple fixed/blurred layers remain composited above or behind it.

**Impact:**

- Mobile browsers can fail to paint scrolled content fast enough.
- The user sees the dark root background before content catches up.
- This matches the reported "all black for a second" scroll symptom.

**Note:** A `@media (hover: none) and (pointer: coarse)` block already exists at [src/styles/app.css:59](../src/styles/app.css#L59), but it only enlarges touch targets — it does **not** disable `backdrop-filter`, the `.pt` particle animation, or the fixed gradients on mobile.

**Recommended fix:**

- Add a mobile performance CSS path.
- Reduce or remove `backdrop-filter` on mobile.
- Disable animated particles during mobile app usage.
- Prefer flat translucent backgrounds over live blur for sticky headers/nav.
- Keep `.scroll-area` and fixed nav layers simple and predictable.
- Add `@media (hover: none) and (pointer: coarse)` overrides for low-cost rendering.

### 3. Workout completion performs too much synchronous work before the UI settles

**Location:** [`confirmWorkoutComplete()` in src/App.jsx:4877](../src/App.jsx#L4877) — spans roughly 120 lines.

Workout completion currently builds log entries, calculates XP, clones/prepends to the full log, scans quests, updates the full profile, triggers XP flash/toast/modal state, and then indirectly triggers profile persistence — all synchronously before the React state update that lets the UI redraw.

Concretely:

1. Build log entries (`flatMap` exercises, `calcExXP`, build entry objects).
2. Reduce entries to a total XP value.
3. Clone & prepend to the full log: `[...entries, ...profile.log]`.
4. Scan auto-quests via `QUESTS.filter(q => q.auto).…`.
5. `setProfile()` updates xp, log, quests, workouts, scheduledWorkouts and runs `applyAutoCheckIn()`.
6. Trigger XP flash, toast, modal close.

**Impact:**

- Large logs make completion increasingly expensive.
- The button can feel unresponsive because computation happens before the user sees meaningful feedback.
- The "Complete workout" delay is likely coming from this path.

**Recommended fix:**

- Give instant UI feedback first: pressed/loading state, modal close, or optimistic completion.
- Move heavy calculations into a dedicated `useWorkoutCompletion` hook.
- Defer non-critical work using `startTransition`, `requestIdleCallback`, or a small queued task.
- Avoid recalculating global data when only one completed workout changed.
- Add timing instrumentation around completion to measure before/after.

---

### 4. Full-profile autosave serializes the entire profile on every profile mutation

**Location:** [src/utils/storage.js:99](../src/utils/storage.js#L99)

Every profile change calls `doSave`, and `doSave` immediately writes the full profile to `localStorage` using `JSON.stringify`. Local storage writes are synchronous and block the main thread.

```js
try { localStorage.setItem(STORAGE_KEY, JSON.stringify(data)); } catch(e) {}
```

Supabase upserts are debounced via a 500ms timer (`SUPABASE_DEBOUNCE_MS`), but the `localStorage` write fires eagerly on every `doSave()` call.

**Impact:**

- Workout completion, favorites, edits, scheduling, history updates, and profile changes all pay a full serialization cost.
- Cost grows as `profile.log` grows.
- Debouncing Supabase helps network traffic but does not avoid the synchronous `localStorage` cost.

**Recommended fix:**

- Debounce `localStorage` writes too.
- Split persisted data into smaller slices if possible.
- Consider saving high-growth data like `log` separately from low-frequency profile preferences.
- Use a dirty-flag / save queue model instead of immediate full-profile writes.
- Flush pending writes on `pagehide` or explicit sign-out.

### 5. Exercise library filtering recomputes large list scans inside render

**Location:** [src/App.jsx:6869](../src/App.jsx#L6869), [src/App.jsx:6984](../src/App.jsx#L6984), [src/App.jsx:7009](../src/App.jsx#L7009)

The exercise library scans `allExercises` several times during render to compute filtered exercises, available muscle groups, available equipment, available types, counts, and home-view data.

**Note:** `allExercises` itself **is** memoized at [src/App.jsx:3424](../src/App.jsx#L3424). The gap is the *derived* outputs — the filtered lists, the available filter sets, and per-muscle counts are recomputed in render rather than memoized.

The local exercise catalog has over 1,500 hardcoded exercises, plus Supabase patching.

**Impact:**

- Search and filter interactions can feel sticky.
- Tab transitions into the exercise library can be slower than necessary.
- Repeated full-list scans add avoidable render cost.

**Recommended fix:**

- Extract exercise library into `features/exercises/ExerciseLibraryTab.jsx`.
- Move filter logic into `useExerciseFilters`.
- Memoize derived filter outputs.
- Precompute stable indexes for muscle, equipment, type, and category.
- Keep virtualization for long visible lists.
- Avoid recalculating home-view counts on every render.

### 6. `src/App.jsx` is too large and owns too many responsibilities

**Location:** [src/App.jsx](../src/App.jsx)

`App.jsx` was **16,204 lines** at audit time and currently owns authentication flow, layout, tabs, workout flows, exercise library, history, profile, social, messages, modals, persistence triggers, and many derived calculations.

**Impact:**

- Small state updates can invalidate very large portions of the app.
- Feature-specific performance problems are harder to isolate.
- Refactors become riskier because unrelated behaviors live in the same file.
- Memoization is less effective when state and callbacks are centralized.

**Recommended target structure** (see migration notes after the tree):

```
src/
  app/
    AppShell.jsx
    MainLayout.jsx
    HudHeader.jsx
    BottomNav.jsx
    AppBackground.jsx

  features/
    workouts/
      WorkoutsTab.jsx
      WorkoutDetail.jsx
      WorkoutBuilder.jsx
      WorkoutCompletionModal.jsx
      useWorkoutCompletion.js

    exercises/
      ExerciseLibraryTab.jsx
      GrimoireGridTab.jsx
      ExercisePicker.jsx
      ExerciseDetailModal.jsx
      useExerciseFilters.js

    history/
      HistoryTab.jsx

    profile/
      ProfileTab.jsx
      ProfileEdit.jsx
      SecuritySettings.jsx
      NotificationSettings.jsx

    calendar/
      CalendarTab.jsx

    social/
      SocialTab.jsx
      MessagesTab.jsx

    quests/
      QuestsTab.jsx
```

**Migration notes — this is a target state, not greenfield:**

- The existing `src/state/` directory already plays the role of the proposed `hooks` location for state hooks (`useAuthState`, `useUiState`). New feature hooks like `useWorkoutCompletion` and `useExerciseFilters` can either live alongside their feature module or continue the `src/state/` convention.
- The existing `src/components/` modules ([`PlansTabContainer`](../src/components/PlansTabContainer.jsx), [`PlanCard`](../src/components/PlanCard.jsx), [`planWizardReducer`](../src/components/planWizardReducer.js), [`PlanWizard`](../src/components/PlanWizard.jsx), [`AdminPage`](../src/components/AdminPage.jsx), [`TrendsTab`](../src/components/TrendsTab.jsx), [`LandingPage`](../src/components/LandingPage.jsx), [`LoginScreen`](../src/components/LoginScreen.jsx)) should migrate **into** the new `features/` tree rather than duplicating into it. Plans currently lives under `components/` and is a good candidate for `features/plans/`.
- Each migration should be its own PR to keep diffs reviewable and avoid mass conflicts.

### Suggested implementation order

1. Extract workout completion flow first (pairs with finding #3). ✅ PR [#118](https://github.com/Brandonla3/aurisar-app/pull/118)
2. Extract exercise library / search / filter next (pairs with finding #5). ✅ PRs [#121](https://github.com/Brandonla3/aurisar-app/pull/121) [#122](https://github.com/Brandonla3/aurisar-app/pull/122) [#123](https://github.com/Brandonla3/aurisar-app/pull/123)
3. Extract shell/layout pieces: HUD, nav, background, toast, XP flash.
4. Extract history / profile / social after the high-impact paths are isolated.
5. Gradually move feature state into hooks once components are stable.

The lowest-risk first PRs (and good warm-ups before #3) are **finding #1 (particle positions)** and **finding #2 (mobile CSS overrides)** — small surface area, no behavior change. ✅ PR [#117](https://github.com/Brandonla3/aurisar-app/pull/117)

### 7. Workout-builder picker: broken virtualization, Sheet blur regression, render churn

**Symptom:** choosing "+ Add Exercise" in the workout builder makes the whole app lag, "as if it's rendering many things at once."

**Locations:** [src/features/workouts/WorkoutExercisePicker.jsx](../src/features/workouts/WorkoutExercisePicker.jsx), [src/features/workouts/WorkoutsTabContainer.jsx](../src/features/workouts/WorkoutsTabContainer.jsx), [src/styles/app.css](../src/styles/app.css), [src/components/ExIcon.jsx](../src/components/ExIcon.jsx)

Three stacked causes, worst first:

1. **The virtualized list wasn't virtualizing.** The react-window `List` was styled `height:100%` inside a `flex:1 1 auto` wrapper whose height is content-driven (the bottom sheet sizes to content up to `max-height`), so the percentage resolved as `auto`: the List element inflated to full content height (~92,580px), its ResizeObserver reported that as the viewport, and **all ~1,543 exercise rows (plus ~1,543 icon `<img>` fetches) rendered on every open and re-rendered on every keystroke**. Because the sheet body is `overflow:hidden`, the inflated list also couldn't be user-scrolled. Measured at 4× CPU throttle (Pixel-7 emulation, dev build): open ≈ 4.7s of long tasks; typing "bench press" ≈ 89s of long tasks with a worst single task of 65s. Fix: give the wrapper `position:relative` and the List `position:absolute; inset:0` so it measures the bounded box, virtualizes (~a dozen rows), and becomes the scroller.
2. **Finding #2 regressed for the ui-sheet era.** The Sheet primitive's `.ui-sheet-backdrop` applies a full-viewport `backdrop-filter: blur(4px)` and was missing from the touch perf override block, as were `.inp`, `.btn-gold`, `.btn-ghost`, `.wb-footer`, and `.wo-sticky-filters`. On desktop, the infinite `.pt` particle animation behind the backdrop forced continuous blur recompositing for as long as any sheet stayed open. Fix: extend the override block; pause `.pt` while a sheet is open.
3. **Render churn multipliers.** `WorkoutsTabContainer` passed freshly-created handler functions to the memo'd `WorkoutsTab` (plus the dead `wbExPickerOpen` prop that the tab never reads), so every picker keystroke/toggle re-rendered the entire tab; the picker recomputed `filtered`/`selIds`/facet counts inline on every render, churning `rowProps` identity for every visible row; `ExIcon` re-ran an ~57-regex scan per row render; App.jsx passed four unstable function props (`openExEditor`, `quickLogSoloEx`, `startLiveWorkout`, `openScheduleEx`) that defeated the container's memo on unrelated App re-renders. Fixes: `useCallback` (named function expressions), `useMemo` + `useDeferredValue`, an icon-name cache, and a `useStableCallback` util for the live-state App handlers.

**Deferred follow-ups:** async-loading the `exercise-data` chunk (tracked in vite.config.js); vendoring the 40 iconify SVGs locally (`scripts/vendor_exercise_icons.mjs` pattern); deferring the picker search `autoFocus` until `animationend` (behavior change — keyboard appears ~300ms later); removing the dead duplicate ExIcon code in `constants.js`; auditing library-tab blur surfaces (`.lib-sticky-search`, `.lib-glass-card`) on touch.

## Non-Goals

This documentation PR does not:

- Change app behavior.
- Remove visual styling.
- Rewrite persistence.
- Replace the current state model in one large refactor.
- Attempt to fully solve performance in a docs-only change.

---

## Validation Plan For Future Code PRs

Future implementation PRs should verify:

- Mobile scrolling no longer flashes black during rapid up/down scroll.
- "Complete workout" gives immediate visual feedback.
- Workout completion remains correct for XP, quests, check-in streaks, logs, scheduled workouts, and toasts.
- Exercise search/filter remains functionally identical.
- Production build passes.
- React Profiler shows reduced commit time for completion and exercise filtering paths.

---

## Risk Notes

The highest-risk area is **workout completion** (finding #3) because it touches logs, XP, quests, check-ins, scheduled workouts, and persistence. That work should be split into a small dedicated PR with before/after testing.

The safest first code change is **stabilizing particle positions** (finding #1) and **adding mobile CSS performance overrides** (finding #2), since those have a smaller behavioral surface.
