/**
 * world/moveGuard.ts — the speed ceiling on client-claimed movement.
 *
 * `movePlayer` is the one hot reducer where the client dictates a value the
 * server cannot re-derive: its own position. It validated only that the point
 * sat inside the world bounds, so a modified client could rewrite its row to
 * anywhere in the world between two calls — and every server-side proximity
 * gate reads that same row (chest opening, vendor buy/sell, dungeon entry,
 * melee range, campfire cooking), so an unbounded position was an unbounded
 * bypass of all of them.
 *
 * The guard is a speed ceiling rather than a bounds check: a call may advance
 * the row by whatever the fastest legitimate client could have covered since
 * the last ACCEPTED move. `player.lastMoveAt` — appended in Batch E for the
 * move-rate floor — is the column that makes that computable.
 *
 * Clamp, never reject. A rejected move leaves the stored row where it was
 * while the client keeps walking locally (movement is client-authoritative and
 * never reconciled), so the player silently desyncs and every proximity gate
 * goes on reading a position they have left. Clamping instead drags the row
 * toward the claim at walking pace: it converges on its own, and a burst of
 * queued updates after a network stall costs a second of catch-up rather than
 * stranding the player.
 *
 * Teleports do not pass through here. respawnPlayer, enterDungeon and
 * leaveDungeon write the row directly, so their jumps are exempt by
 * construction, and the next movePlayer simply measures from wherever the
 * teleport left them.

 *
 * It is also the term that decides how far the ceiling can be pushed: a client
 * calling at the 40 ms floor banks this much per call on top of its legitimate
 * speed, so 0.75 m/call works out to roughly 2.5x walking pace sustained.
 * That is the deliberate trade — enough slack that honest movement is never
 * touched, in exchange for turning "reach any point in the world instantly"
 * into "walk there". A tighter ceiling needs a real credit bucket (spare
 * budget carried between calls in its own column), which is a bigger change
