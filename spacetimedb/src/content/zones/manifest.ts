/**
 * zones/manifest.ts — the zone progression map.
 *
 * Zone 1 is a NEW map (reference-style hub + camps + roads) — its
 * worldgen config (zone1_world.json) lands in P1. Ashwood is intentionally
 * NOT in this manifest: it stays in the repo as a dev/test world only.
 * Level bands cap at 35 until more zones ship (plan §2b). All names are
 * placeholders for the story pass.
